Assignment: Designing a Multipage Streamlit App with Project Management Elements

Objective
In this assignment, you will apply the skills you’ve acquired in creating a multipage Streamlit application
using Google BigQuery as the backend database. This time, you will analyze a dataset of your choice from
Kaggle.

Assignment Overview
1. Dataset Selection:
• Choose a dataset from Kaggle that interests you. The dataset should be substantial enough
to allow for meaningful analysis but manageable within the timeframe.
• Make sure the dataset is publicly available and accessible to all team members.

2. Streamlit Application Requirements:
• Multipage Structure: Your application should consist of multiple pages, each focusing on
different aspects of the data analysis.
• UI Elements: Incorporate a variety of Streamlit UI elements (e.g., dropdowns, sliders, text
inputs) to allow users to interact with the data.
• Graphs and Visualizations: Use Plotly to create at least three different types of visualizations
(e.g., line charts, bar charts, scatter plots) that help in analyzing the dataset.
• Data Querying: Utilize Google BigQuery for querying the dataset. Each page should include
at least one query to filter or manipulate the data.
• Query Testing: All SQL queries used in the Streamlit code must first be tested and verified
in Google BigQuery before being implemented in the application.
